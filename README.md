## Background and Overview
When studying for long periods of time, it is extremely easy to get distracted and start procrastinating. StudyDash is a minimalistic sleek dashboard app that will allow you to focus through various widgets such as a pomodoro clock, deadline reminders, as well as studying analytics.

StudyDash will also allow a user to listen to music while studying, add deadlines that also show up in a calendar to help users keep track of time and eliminate procrastination. Users will also be able to check how much time they have spent on breaks vs. studying. There is also a flashcards widget that will allow users to create flashcards to practice studying content.
